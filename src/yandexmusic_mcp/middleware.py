"""FastMCP middleware for the Yandex Music server.

``TimingMiddleware`` logs each tool call's wall-clock duration at debug level —
lightweight observability that composes with FastMCP's middleware chain.
(Error messages are made user-friendly at their source in ``client.py``, since
FastMCP resolves a tool's exception into its own ToolError below the middleware
layer.)
